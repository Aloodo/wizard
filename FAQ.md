FAQ

**What's California Privacy Wizard?**

California Privacy Wizard is a service providing
third-party opt-outs under the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA).  It helps you sign up to prevent
your personal information from being traded and sold
by database marketers.

**zzzz, sorry, you bored me to sleep there, what was
that again?**

California Privacy Wizard is an epic game of wizard
battles that you play by tagging people on Twitter.

**That's more like it. Wait a minute, why is a big
brand sponsoring this?  I thought marketing people
were all butthurt about the CCPA!**

According to opinion polls and market research, CCPA
is the most popular trend in California since the
Gold Rush, with 87%% support!  Our brand is riding
that sweet California privacy goodwill and making a
fun game for our customers at the same time, so it's
a total win-win no-brainer over here. (finger guns)

**Do I have to log in with Twitter?**

Yes, that way we know what trackers you have opted
out of.  Also, because it's a Twitter game.

**Wait a minute, isn't Twitter an online tracker?**

lol have you even seen the ads on Twitter? Whatever
they're doing over there it's not the scary accurate
kind of tracking.

**How do I get new spells?**

You can only get new spells by opting out of trackers.

**Do I get experience points (XP) for opting out
of tracking?**

No, you only get XP for defeating wizards in wizard
battle, or when your apprentices do.

**How do I challenge another player to a wizard battle?**

Tweet their name, tag the game, hashtag the spell
you are casting.

```
#scry @dmarti @californiaprivacywizard
```

**Can I put other stuff in the tweet and still have
it count for the game?**

Yes, the game only looks for its own Twitter username,
the username of the target, and the hashtag for
the spell.  You can say anything else in the Tweet
and it will be ignored.

**I defeated my friend in a wizard battle, where's
my XP?**

You get experience points for defeating a wizard
whose level is at least one less than yours.

If you are level 3 and your friend is level 1,
they would need to level up before you get XP for
defeating them.

**Do I get more XP for defeating a wizard at higher
levels?**

Yes.  See the XP table.

**Can I level up more than once as the result of a
single battle?**

Yes.

**How many apprentices can I have?**

You can have as many apprentices as you like. They
continue to be your apprentices until they equal or
surpass your level.

**How do I enroll an apprentice?**

You can enroll an apprentice as soon as you are no
longer the apprentice of another wizard.

To enroll someone, tag them on Twitter, use the
`#apprentice` hashtag, and tag the game.

```
#apprentice @dmarti @californiaprivacywizard
```

As with spell Tweets, you can put extra text in the
Tweet if you want.

connection to your sponsor?**
